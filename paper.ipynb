cardiac arrhythmia  characterized  by  the  irregularity  and  speed  of  cardiac  contractions   Kumar   Pachori   &  Acharya   number    Atrial  fibrillation  AFIB  is a common health problem not only in  developed  countries  but  also  in  developing  countries   Hernandez  et  al    number   Xia  et  al    number   Wang   Wang   &  Wang  number   AFIB affects some number million people

 people  in  Europe will  be  affected  by  number   Other  disorders  including  heart  valve  disease   diabetes  mellitus   arterial  hypertension  and  overweight obesity   as  well  as  metabolic  syndrome  and  its  components  sleep  apnea  and  inflammation   have  significant  epidemiological  associations  with  AFIB   In  addition  to  genetic  factors   more  recent  research  has  centered  on  modifiable lifestyle factors such as alcohol intake and physical  activity  Lippi  Sanchis-Gomar  & Cervellin  number     Since  AFIB  can  cause  strokes   heart  failure   and  even  death if not detected and treated promptly  automatic detection  of AFIB is a critical requirement  Hernandez et al   number  Xia  et al   number  Wang  Wang  & Wang  number   Furthermore  the  economic and clinical burden of AFIB is significant and will  continue  to  rise  in  the  future  due  to  high  rates  of  hospitalization and extensive use of health resources  Asgari   Mehrnia  & Moussavi  number     Some  people  may  be  unaware  that  they  have  atrial  fibrillation because it does not often cause visible symptoms   Curry et al   number   Especially paroxysmal atrial fibrillation  shows a silent course and its detection may require continuous  monitoring   As  a  result   early  detection  and  screening  are  important  Early detection of AFIB can thus allow for more  effective  management  and  avoid  future  complications   Mairesse et al   number     ECG  signals  are  often  used  to  diagnose  AFIB   Kumar   Pachori  &  Acharya   number   Wang   Wang   &

number     This  study  compares  the  performance  of  different  cardiologists  and  an  A I   model  called  CurAlive  with  the  reference of number-lead gold standard ECG interpretations  The  main aim of the study is to compare the performance of AFIB  detection  from  only  lead-I   Detecting  only  AFIB  is  not  sufficient for automatic ECG interpretation  NSR and OTHER  rhythm  types  should  also  be  automatically  interpreted   However  it is difficult to say that patient has NSR from only  lead-I   because  the  ECGs  can  contain  another  confusing  rhythm or beat types like AVBs  CDs  LBBB and RBBB    II   MATERIAL AND METHODS   A   Clinical study procedure   The  clinical  study  aimed  to  investigate  how  much  information can be extracted from the ECG using only lead-I   and  to  compare  the  diagnostic  performance  of  the  artificial  intelligence  supported  ECG  analysis  system  of  CurAlive   a  product of Notrino Research  with the diagnostic performance  of cardiologists on lead-I  Thus  the role of dry electrode and  single  lead  mobile  ECG  devices  in  AFIB  diagnosis  will  be  examined in the future  The detailed schematic diagram of the  clinical study is given in Figure number    In  the  study   leadnumber  ECG  recordings  ranging  from  number  seconds to number seconds were analyzed by number expert cardiologists   and CurAlive  Cardiologists were asked to identify which of  the ECG records were AFIB  NSR or OTHER  Cardiologists  were instructed to choose the  OTHER  class if any abnormal  rhythm  or  abnormal  beat  other  than  AFIB  and  NSR  were  involved  If there is another rhythm type at the same time as  AFIB in the ECGs examined  this class was accepted as AFIB    Fig  number   The schematic diagram of the clinical study   The  same  ECG  recordings  were  sent  to  CurAlive's  artificial intelligence supported ECG analysis system running  on  the  web  and  the  results  were  recorded   CurAlive  is  an  artificial intelligence supported mobile ECG patient tracking  system that is in the development process  CurAlive consists  of two different single lead and number-lead ECG devices  artificial  intelligence-supported  ECG  analysis  system  and  a  patient  tracking system  At the same time  the devices can measure  oxygen saturation level with embedded PPG sensors and can  measure  body  temperature   The  number-lead  ECG  device  also  enables pacemakers to be monitored remotely with its pacedetection feature  The prepared ECG data were transmitted to  the  web-based  and  artificial  intelligence  supported  ECG  analysis  system  in  JSON  format  with  the  username  and  password  provided  by  the  company  in  accordance  with  the  data  security  rules  and  the  results  were  obtained   CurAlive  ECG analysis system is a system that can differentiate in NSR   AFIB  OTHER and NOISE classes by analyzing ECG signals  between  numbernumber  seconds  in  time  and  frequency  space  using  continuous  wavelet  transformation  and  convolutional  neural  networks   OTHER   It  is  a  superclass  used  to  identify  ECG  signals other than NSR and AFIB  NOISE  on the other hand   is a class that describes the noises that are not considered as  ECG signals  CurAlive's CNN model was trained using PTBXL  MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database and CurAlive ECG  Noise Database     Cardiologists  and  CurAlive  have  interpreted  without  knowing  where  the  data  came  from  and  what's  inside   Cardiologists also have evaluated ECGs independently from  each other    Fig  number   a  CurAlive A I  DenseNet type CNN architecture  b  CurAlive mobile ECG device   number the splitted ECGs time and class distributions can be seen as  histograms    B

to diagnose  In order for cardiologists to examine ECGs  only the leadI derivation of ECGs was selected from the number-lead ECG data  set and ECGs were recorded as pictures  The recorded pictures  were uploaded to the web-based image annotation tool called  “zillin io”   allowing  each  cardiologist  to  examine  the  same  data  separately  and  independently   The  cardiologists   following  an  examination  of  the  ECG  results   selected  the  appropriate  choice  from  the  checkbox  in  the  system   which  included  NSR   AFIB   OTHER   or  NOT-SURE   Some  ECG  images presented to

 segments   number  additional  ECG  signals  have  been  generated   A  fourth  cardiologist  was  assigned  to  make  sure  that the ECG interpretations are the same with Chinese doctors  and  not  changed  after  the  splitting  process   In  this  way   the  diagnoses made by Chinese doctors were confirmed  In Figure   Fig  number   Some  of  the  ECGs  uploaded  to  zillin io  online  image  annotation  system    C   Statistical analysis   The results of the number-lead ECGs were compared with the  results  of  each  cardiologist  one  by  one  and  the  confusion  matrices  were  calculated   Precision   Recall  and  Fnumber-Score  values  and  weighted  average  values  of  each  metric  have  calculated as given in the equations below     𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑊𝑊𝑊𝑊 = Kappa   κ   coefficients  for  interobserver  agreement  were  assessed   κ  coefficients  are  calculated  with  this  formula  below   In  this  formula  Pr a   represents  the  actual  observed  agreement   and  Pr e   represents  chance  agreement   The  κ  coefficient  between  CurAlive  classifications  and  number-lead  reference  ECG  interpretation  labels  are  calculated  as  number number   Kappa  results  are  interpreted  as  follows   values  ≤   number  as  indicating  no  agreement  and  number number–number number  as  none  to  slight   number number–number number  as  fair

   number  CI intervals have also calculated  The intervals have  κ = an associated confidence levels that gives the probability with  which the estimated interval will contain the true value of the  parameter    All  metrics  have  been  calculated  for  CurAlive  and  visualized  on  comparison  tables   ROC  curves   Receiver  Operating  Characteristics   and  AUC   Area  Under  Curve   values  were  also  calculated  by  using  the  estimated  rhythms  and estimation accuracy values    D   Internal consistency among cardiologists   The main reason for working with number cardiologists were to  increase  the  reliability  of  the  study   For  this  reason   it  has  desired to see how much collective decision that cardiologists  make   Comparing  the  decisions  of  cardiologists  with  each  other  had  been  one  way  to  demonstrate  this   Therefore   number  confusion matrices were prepared by comparing the decisions  of each cardiologist with the decision of another cardiologist    III   RESULTS   A   Evaluation of the model and performance comparison   with the cardiologists  Using the image annotation tool zillin io  all number ECG files  prepared  for  cardiologists'  evaluation  were  evaluated  separately  from  one  another  according  to  the  AFIB   NOTSURE  NSR  and OTHER groups  All of the same ECGs were  also analyzed by CurAlive for comparison    The performance of each cardiologist and CurAlive have  been tested by taking the evaluations made with number-channel  ECGs  as  a  reference   Cardiologists  have  classified  ECGs  according to AFIB  NOT-SURE  NSR and OTHER classes   CurAlive  is  a  model  that  can  classify  according  to  AFIB   NOISE  NSR and OTHER classes  In the data set consisting  of  number-channel  ECGs  and  labeled  with  reference  diagnoses   only AFIB  NSR and OTHER classes have been available  As  a result   macro average values of performance  metrics have  been ignored  as macro average values of performance metrics  cannot produce accurate results    In the initial evaluations  the weighted average precision   weighted  average  recall   weighted  average  Fnumber-score   and

average was number number   The average of OTHER Fnumber-score  was calculated as number number   while CurAlive's average score was   number number  It was determined that the accuracy of the cardiologists  was number number   while the accuracy of CurAlive was number number     \fR waves can be seen easily in lead-I  more accurate results can  be  seen  in  AFIB  diagnosis  compared  to  other  classes   It  appears that all three cardiologists have made serious mistakes  while interpreting the NSR and OTHER classes  The common  occurrence of errors demonstrates the strength of diagnostic  correlation between cardiologists  The main reason for this is  that  ECG  records  belonging  to  rhythms  and  beats  of  AVB   CDs   LBBB   RBBB   PAC   PVC   STD  and  STE  types  in  OTHER  class  are  difficult  to  classify  by  using  only  lead-I  derivation  NSR and other specified rhythm and beat types can  create very similar patterns in lead-I derivation    When the CurAlive's confusion matrix  shown in Figure number   is analyzed  it can be shown that the model has high selectivity  across  all  groups   It  is  able  to  detect  rhythms  and  beats  of  AVB  CDs  LBBB  RBBB  PAC  PVC  STD and STE types  even  from  lead-I  and  distinguish  them  from  NSR  class   In  AFIB detection  it is seen that it can classify AFIB from leadI with a high performance

true  negative  and  false  negative  values  are  extracted  from  calculated  confusion  matrices  These matrices also gave us the ability to evaluate  the results in a subjective way  On these matrices  it can be  seen  that  CurAlive  made  predictions  that  are  almost  perfect  compared  to  cardiologists   Cardiologists  confused  OTHER  class  as  NSR  most  of  the  time   This  is  expected  because  without any useful information from other ECG derivations   only lead-I derivation is a poor way to interpret ECGs with  humans    Fig  number   CurAlive  receiver  operating  characteristics  curves  and  area  under  curve values   The trained A I  system was evaluated on the CPSCnumber test  dataset  We used the receiver operating characteristic  ROC   curves to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy  On the test dataset   the ROC curve  Fig  number  showed AUC of three categories were  respectively  number number   for  AFIB    number number   for  NSR    number number   for  OTHER    and  the  micro  average  is  number number   Besides   precision  and recall for AFIB were number number  and number number  respectively  The  AUC value for AFIB calculated as number number that means the model  has perfect diagnostic accuracy for diagnosing AFIB    B   Total agreement between cardiologists   All cardiologists have given similar performance for the  AFIB class  But it can easily be seen in the confusion matrices  between  cardiologists  that  there  are  some  misclassifications  for AFIB class  Figure number   It is due to the absence of P waves  that can't be easily seen on lead-I ECGs  On the other hand  NSR  and  OTHER  classes  are  mostly  confused  with  each  other  From the results the p values are calculated as zero that  means  significant  correlation  between  cardiologists’  decisions  With  this  knowledge  it  can  be  said  that  when  diagnosing  most  of  the  OTHER  type  ECGs  the  cardiologists made near random choices with no correlation   So for interpreting some ECGs the lead-I is most of the time  useless and difficult for humans for making decisions about  the ECGs    is  no   there   Fig  number   Confusion  matrices  between  ground  truth  number-lead  interpretations  and each cardiologist and CurAlive   In Figure number  Three cardiologists and CurAlive's Confusion  Matrix have given in the comparison made with reference to  number-lead ground truth interpretations  The number of ECGs on  which  cardiologists  are  unsure  is  extremely  low   The  irregularity of R waves and the absence of P waves are two  important diagnostic parameters when diagnosing AFIB  The  fact that P waves in lead-I appear flatter than lead-II  which  makes AFIB diagnosis from lead-I difficult  However  since   \fAsensi et al

Support Vector Machine  SVM  with a  number   accuracy  is  used  to  access  the  final  result   Limam  &  Precioso  number     to  classify  ECG  signals   By searching at other studies in the literature  it's clear that  single lead  number-Lead  and number-Lead ECGs  as well as evaluations  made  with  various  data  sources   yield  results  with  varying  confidence  intervals   In  this  research   as  a  result  of  the  evaluation of the artificial intelligence model called CurAlive   it was found as number number  precision  number number  recall and number number  FnumberScore   CurAlive  has  found  that  its  diagnostic  power  is  significantly  higher  than  cardiologists  when  compared  with  cardiologists and the actual ground truth diagnosis of number

>number  in number   Lippi et al  number   AFIB is one of the most important global  health  problem   Early  AFIB  diagnosis  has  a  very  important  role of solving this global problem  Thus  mobile ECG patient  tracking systems and A I  powered decision making systems  are going to play a critical role  This clinical study showed that  CurAlive is a reliable  accessible and inexpensive tool to make  possible the early diagnosis of AFIB    V   CONCLUSION   Lead-I  ECG  devices  have  frequently  been  used  in  the  diagnosis of normal sinus rhythm and atrial fibrillation  It is  not  always  easy  for  healthcare  professionals  to  diagnose  normal  sinus  rhythm  from  lead-I  ECGs   Because  some  rhythms can be interpreted differently in lead-I derivation  it  is recommended in the literature to be controlled with number-lead  ECGs  However  it is important to develop the systems using  lead-I ECGs due to reasons such as limited accessibility of number Fig  number   Confusion matrices between each cardiologists   IV   DISCUSSION   Atrial  fibrillation  is  mostly  asymptomatic   making  it  difficult to diagnose  but it is associated to stroke  heart failure   and death  Existing screening methods necessitate long-term  monitoring and are cost and yield constrained  This study is to  compare the accuracy of the diagnoses estimated by doctors  and  artificial  intelligence  over  lead-I  ECGs  using  number-lead  ECGs  as  ground  truth  references   In  the  literature   many  studies on AFIB diagnosis using various artificial intelligence  models have been found     The  development  of  an  automated  and  efficient  method  that monitors AFIB in real time will likely be a key component  in achieving public health goals for reducing disease-induced  deaths   Faust   Ciaccio    &  Acharya   number    In  a  study  conducted by Duerte et al   number   it has been suggested that  lead-I ECG can be used as an easily accessible and economical  pioneering  evidence  in  the  diagnosis  of  AFIB  in   primary  care  healthcare institutions  Duarte et al   number   In another  study  reported  by  Taggar  et   al    number    three  studies  were  undertaken  number  a systematic review and meta-analysis of the  for  detecting  pulse  diagnostic  accuracy  of  methods  irregularities  caused  by  AFIB   number   a  systematic  review  and  meta-analysis  of  the  diagnostic  accuracy  of  methods  for  diagnosing AFIB using number-lead ECG and number  a survey of HCPs  in primary care about screening implementation  Automated  ECG-interpretation software most accurately excluded AFIB   although  its  ability  to  diagnose  this  was  similar  to  all  healthcare professionals  Indirect comparisons with software  found  healthcare  professionals   Taggar  et al    number    In  Pourbabaee et al ’s  number  study  number-second ECG data of number  women  were  taken  and  evaluated  with  CNN   ECGs  were  monitored by the patients at least number times a day for six weeks   On  validation  and  testing  data  sets  created  from  different  recordings  of  the  same  participants   an  overall  window  accuracy of number number  and number number  achieved  Pourbabaee et al    number      \flead  ECG  devices   Also  number  lead  devices  are  impractical   expensive and incompatible with remote monitoring systems  with  existing  technology   CureAlive  identified  AFIB  using  lead-I  ECGs   with  nearly  number-lead  ECGs  sensitivity  and  significantly higher diagnostic power than cardiologists which  use lead-I    These  results  are  promising  in  increasing  the  early  diagnosis  capacity  of remote  patient  monitoring  systems   In  this way  it can be said that CureAlive can contribute to the  diagnosis  of  cardiac  emergencies  practically   early   quickly  and  cheaply   With  future  enhancements   it  is  estimated  that  CurAlive will also be able to detect other abnormal rhythms  and beats that can only be identified with number-lead ECGs using  lead-I ECGs  Based on these results  it is planned to conduct a  research  on  diagnosis  of  MI  from  lead-I  ECGs  using  prospective  patient  data   It  can  be  speculated  that  CurAlive  will be capable of diagnosing other abnormalities thanks to its  flexible design  so it is likely to be used for the diagnosis of  other heart  kidney  and endocrinological diseases in the earlyfuture    VI   ACKNOWLEDGMENT   We would like to thank Notrino Research for their help in  this study and for
