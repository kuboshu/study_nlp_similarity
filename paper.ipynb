      "Designing Network Design Spaces Ilija Radosavovic Raj Prateek Kosaraju Ross Girshick Kaiming He Facebook AI Research (FAIR) In this work, we present a new network design paradigm. Our goal is to help advance the understanding of network design and discover design principles that generalize across settings. Instead of focusing on designing individual network instances, we design network design spaces that parametrize populations of networks. The overall process is analogous to classic manual design of networks, but elevated to the design space level. Using our methodology we explore the structure aspect of network design and arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple, regular networks that we call RegNet. The core insight of the RegNet parametrization is surprisingly simple: widths and depths of good networks can be explained by a quantized linear function. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting ﬁndings that do not match the current practice of network design. The RegNet design space provides simple and fast networks that work well across a wide range of ﬂop regimes. Under comparable training settings and ﬂops, the RegNet models outperform the popular EfﬁcientNet models while being up to 0× faster on GPUs. Deep convolutional neural networks are the engine of visual recognition. Over the past several years better architectures have resulted in considerable progress in a wide range of visual recognition tasks. Examples include LeNet [0], AlexNet [0], VGG [0], and ResNet [0]. This body of work advanced both the effectiveness of neural networks as well as our understanding of network design. In particular, the above sequence of works demonstrated the importance of convolution, network and data size, depth, and residuals, respectively. The outcome of these works is not just particular network instantiations, but also design principles that can be generalized and applied to numerous settings. While manual network design has led to large advances, ﬁnding well-optimized networks manually can be challenging, especially as the number of design choices increases. A popular approach to address this limitation is neural architecture search (NAS). Given a ﬁxed search space of possible Figure 0. Design space design. We propose to design network design spaces, where a design space is a parametrized set of possible model architectures. Design space design is akin to manual network design, but elevated to the population level. In each step of our process the input is an initial design space and the output is a reﬁned design space of simpler or better models. Following [0], we characterize the quality of a design space by sampling models and inspecting their error distribution. For example, in the ﬁgure above we start with an initial design space A and apply two reﬁnement steps to yield design spaces B then C. In this case C ⊆ B ⊆A (left), and the error distributions are strictly improving from A to B to C (right). The hope is that design principles that apply to model populations are more likely to be robust and generalize. networks, NAS automatically ﬁnds a good model within the search space. Recently, NAS has received a lot of attention and shown excellent results [0, 0, 0]. Despite the effectiveness of NAS, the paradigm has limitations. The outcome of the search is a single network instance tuned to a speciﬁc setting (e.g., hardware platform). This is sufﬁcient in some cases; however, it does not enable discovery of network design principles that deepen our understanding and allow us to generalize to new settings. In particular, our aim is to ﬁnd simple models that are easy to understand, build upon, and generalize. In this work, we present a new network design paradigm that combines the advantages of manual design and NAS. Instead of focusing on designing individual network instances, we design design spaces that parametrize populations of networks.0 Like in manual design, we aim for interpretability and to discover general design principles that describe networks that are simple, work well, and generalize across settings. Like in NAS, we aim to take advantage of semi-automated procedures to help achieve these goals. 0We use the term design space following [0], rather than search space, to emphasize that we are not searching for network instances within the space. Instead, we are designing the space itself. ABCBCA\fThe general strategy we adopt is to progressively design simpliﬁed versions of an initial, relatively unconstrained, design space while maintaining or improving its quality (Figure 0). The overall process is analogous to manual design, elevated to the population level and guided via distribution estimates of network design spaces [0]. As a testbed for this paradigm, our focus is on exploring network structure (e.g., width, depth, groups, etc.) assuming standard model families including VGG [0], ResNet [0], and ResNeXt [0]. We start with a relatively unconstrained design space we call AnyNet (e.g., widths and depths vary freely across stages) and apply our humanin-the-loop methodology to arrive at a low-dimensional design space consisting of simple “regular” networks, that we call RegNet. The core of the RegNet design space is simple: stage widths and depths are determined by a quantized linear function. Compared to AnyNet, the RegNet design space has simpler models, is easier to interpret, and has a higher concentration of good models. We design the RegNet design space in a low-compute, low-epoch regime using a single network block type on ImageNet [0]. We then show that the RegNet design space generalizes to larger compute regimes, schedule lengths, and network block types. Furthermore, an important property of the design space design is that it is more interpretable and can lead to insights that we can learn from. We analyze the RegNet design space and arrive at interesting ﬁndings that do not match the current practice of network design. For example, we ﬁnd that the depth of the best models is stable across compute regimes (∼0 blocks) and that the best models do not use either a bottleneck or inverted bottleneck. We compare top REGNET models to existing networks in various settings. First, REGNET models are surprisingly effective in the mobile regime. We hope that these simple models can serve as strong baselines for future work. Next, REGNET models lead to considerable improvements over standard RESNE(X)T [0, 0] models in all metrics. We highlight the improvements for ﬁxed activations, which is of high practical interest as the number of activations can strongly inﬂuence the runtime on accelerators such as GPUs. Next, we compare to the state-of-the-art EFFICIENTNET [0] models across compute regimes. Under comparable training settings and ﬂops, REGNET models outperform EFFICIENTNET models while being up to 0× faster on GPUs. We further test generalization on ImageNetV0 [0]. We note that network structure is arguably the simplest form of a design space design one can consider. Focusing on designing richer design spaces (e.g., including operators) may lead to better networks. Nevertheless, the structure will likely remain a core component of such design spaces. In order to facilitate future research we will release all code and pretrained models introduced in this work.0 0. Related Work Manual network design. The introduction of AlexNet [0] catapulted network design into a thriving research area. In the following years, improved network designs were proposed; examples include VGG [0], Inception [0 0], ResNet [0], ResNeXt [0], DenseNet [0], and MobileNet [0, 0]. The design process behind these networks was largely manual and focussed on discovering new design choices that improve accuracy e.g., the use of deeper models or residuals. We likewise share the goal of discovering new design principles. In fact, our methodology is analogous to manual design but performed at the design space level. Automated network design. Recently, the network design process has shifted from a manual exploration to more automated network design, popularized by NAS. NAS has proven to be an effective tool for ﬁnding good models, e.g., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. The majority of work in NAS focuses on the search algorithm, i.e., efﬁciently ﬁnding the best network instances within a ﬁxed, manually designed search space (which we call a design space). Instead, our focus is on a paradigm for designing novel design spaces. The two are complementary: better design spaces can improve the efﬁciency of NAS search algorithms and also lead to existence of better models by enriching the design space. Network scaling. Both manual and semi-automated network design typically focus on ﬁnding best-performing network instances for a speciﬁc regime (e.g., number of ﬂops comparable to ResNet-0). Since the result of this procedure is a single network instance, it is not clear how to adapt the instance to a different regime (e.g., fewer ﬂops). A common practice is to apply network scaling rules, such as varying network depth [0], width [0], resolution [0], or all three jointly [0]. Instead, our goal is to discover general design principles that hold across regimes and allow for efﬁcient tuning for the optimal network in any target regime. Comparing networks. Given the vast number of possible network design spaces, it is essential to use a reliable comparison metric to guide our design process. Recently, the authors of [0] proposed a methodology for comparing and analyzing populations of networks sampled from a design space. This distribution-level view is fully-aligned with our goal of ﬁnding general design principles. Thus, we adopt this methodology and demonstrate that it can serve as a useful tool for the design space design process. Parameterization. Our ﬁnal quantized linear parameterization shares similarity with previous work, e.g. how stage widths are set [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. However, there are two key differences. First, we provide an empirical study justifying the design choices we make. Second, we give insights into structural design choices that were not previously understood (e.g., how to set the number of blocks in each stages). 0. Design Space Design Our goal is to design better networks for visual recognition. Rather than designing or searching for a single best model under speciﬁc settings, we study the behavior of populations of models. We aim to discover general design principles that can apply to and improve an entire model population. Such design principles can provide insights into network design and are more likely to generalize to new settings (unlike a single model tuned for a speciﬁc scenario). We rely on the concept of network design spaces introduced by Radosavovic et al. [0]. A design space is a large, possibly inﬁnite, population of model architectures. The core insight from [0] is that we can sample models from a design space, giving rise to a model distribution, and turn to tools from classical statistics to analyze the design space. We note that this differs from architecture search, where the goal is to ﬁnd the single best model from the space. In this work, we propose to design progressively simpliﬁed versions of an initial, unconstrained design space. We refer to this process as design space design. Design space design is akin to sequential manual network design, but elevated to the population level. Speciﬁcally, in each step of our design process the input is an initial design space and the output is a reﬁned design space, where the aim of each design step is to discover design principles that yield populations of simpler or better performing models. We begin by describing the basic tools we use for design space design in §0. Next, in §0 we apply our methodology to a design space, called AnyNet, that allows unconstrained network structures. In §0, after a sequence of design steps, we obtain a simpliﬁed design space consisting of only regular network structures that we name RegNet. Finally, as our goal is not to design a design space for a single setting, but rather to discover general principles of network design that generalize to new settings, in §0 we test the generalization of the RegNet design space to new settings. Relative to the AnyNet design space, the RegNet design space is: (0) simpliﬁed both in terms of its dimension and type of network conﬁgurations it permits, (0) contains a higher concentration of top-performing models, and (0) is more amenable to analysis and interpretation. 0. Tools for Design Space Design We begin with an overview of tools for design space design. To evaluate and compare design spaces, we use the tools introduced by Radosavovic et al. [0], who propose to quantify the quality of a design space by sampling a set of models from that design space and characterizing the resulting model error distribution. The key intuition behind this approach is that comparing distributions is more robust and informative than using search (manual or automated) and comparing the best found models from two design spaces. Figure 0. Statistics of the AnyNetX design space computed with n = 0 sampled models. Left: The error empirical distribution function (EDF) serves as our foundational tool for visualizing the quality of the design space. In the legend we report the min error and mean error (which corresponds to the area under the curve). Middle: Distribution of network depth d (number of blocks) versus error. Right: Distribution of block widths in the fourth stage (w0) versus error. The blue shaded regions are ranges containing the best models with 0% conﬁdence (obtained using an empirical bootstrap), and the black vertical line the most likely best value. To obtain a distribution of models, we sample and train n models from a design space. For efﬁciency, we primarily do so in a low-compute, low-epoch training regime. In particular, in this section we use the 0 million ﬂop0 (0MF) regime and train each sampled model for 0 epochs on the ImageNet dataset [0]. We note that while we train many training 0 models at models, each training run is fast: 0MF for 0 epochs is roughly equivalent in ﬂops to training a single ResNet-0 [0] model at 0GF for 0 epochs. As in [0], our primary tool for analyzing design space quality is the error empirical distribution function (EDF). The error EDF of n models with errors ei is given by: F (e) = 0[ei < e]. F (e) gives the fraction of models with error less than e. We show the error EDF for n = 0 sampled models from the AnyNetX design space (described in §0) in Figure 0 (left). Given a population of trained models, we can plot and analyze various network properties versus network error, see Figure 0 (middle) and (right) for two examples taken from the AnyNetX design space. Such visualizations show 0D projections of a complex, high-dimensional space, and can help obtain insights into the design space. For these plots, we employ an empirical bootstrap0 [0] to estimate the likely range in which the best models fall. To summarize: (0) we generate distributions of models obtained by sampling and training n models from a design space, (0) we compute and plot error EDFs to summarize design space quality, (0) we visualize various properties of a design space and use an empirical bootstrap to gain insight, and (0) we use these insights to reﬁne the design space. 0Following common practice, we use ﬂops to mean multiply-adds. Moreover, we use MF and GF to denote 0 and 0 ﬂops, respectively. 0Given n pairs (xi, ei) of model statistic xi (e.g. depth) and corresponding error ei, we compute the empirical bootstrap by: (0) sampling with replacement 0% of the pairs, (0) selecting the pair with min error in the sample, (0) repeating this 0 times, and ﬁnally (0) computing the 0% CI for the min x value. The median gives the most likely best value. spaces. (a) Each network consists of a stem (stride-two 0×0 conv with w0 = 0 output channels), followed by the network body that performs the bulk of the computation, and then a head (average pooling followed by a fully connected layer) that predicts n output classes. (b) The network body is composed of a sequence of stages that operate at progressively reduced resolution ri. (c) Each stage consists of a sequence of identical blocks, except the ﬁrst block which uses stride-two conv. While the general structure is simple, the total number of possible network conﬁgurations is vast. 0. The AnyNet Design Space We next introduce our initial AnyNet design space. Our focus is on exploring the structure of neural networks assuming standard, ﬁxed network blocks (e.g., residual bottleneck blocks). In our terminology the structure of the network includes elements such as the number of blocks (i.e. network depth), block widths (i.e. number of channels), and other block parameters such as bottleneck ratios or group widths. The structure of the network determines the distribution of compute, parameters, and memory throughout the computational graph of the network and is key in determining its accuracy and efﬁciency. The basic design of networks in our AnyNet design space is straightforward. Given an input image, a network consists of a simple stem, followed by the network body that performs the bulk of the computation, and a ﬁnal network head that predicts the output classes, see Figure 0a. We keep the stem and head ﬁxed and as simple as possible, and instead focus on the structure of the network body that is central in determining network compute and accuracy. The network body consists of 0 stages operating at progressively reduced resolution, see Figure 0b (we explore varying the number of stages in §0). Each stage consists of a sequence of identical blocks, see Figure 0c. In total, for each stage i the degrees of freedom include the number of blocks di, block width wi, and any other block parameters. While the general structure is simple, the total number of possible networks in the AnyNet design space is vast. Most of our experiments use the standard residual bottlenecks block with group convolution [0], shown in Figure 0 We refer to this as the X block, and the AnyNet design space built on it as AnyNetX (we explore other blocks in §0). While the X block is quite rudimentary, we show it can be surprisingly effective when network structure is optimized. Figure 0. The X block is based on the standard residual bottleneck block with group convolution [0]. (a) Each X block consists of a 0×0 conv, a 0×0 group conv, and a ﬁnal 0×0 conv, where the 0×0 convs alter the channel width. BatchNorm [0] and ReLU follow each conv. The block has 0 parameters: the width wi, bottleneck ratio bi, and group width gi. (b) The stride-two (s = 0) version. The AnyNetX design space has 0 degrees of freedom as each network consists of 0 stages and each stage i has 0 parameters: the number of blocks di, block width wi, bottleneck ratio bi, and group width gi. We ﬁx the input resolution r = 0 unless otherwise noted. To obtain valid models, we perform log-uniform sampling of di ≤ 0, wi ≤ 0 and divisible by 0, bi ∈ {0, 0, 0}, and gi ∈ {0, 0, . . . , 0} (we test these ranges later). We repeat the sampling until we obtain n = 0 models in our target complexity regime (0MF to 0MF), and train each model for 0 epochs.0 Basic statistics for AnyNetX were shown in Figure 0 There are (0·0·0·0)0 ≈ 0 possible model conﬁgurations in the AnyNetX design space. Rather than searching for the single best model out of these ∼0 conﬁgurations, we explore whether there are general design principles that can help us understand and reﬁne this design space. To do so, we apply our approach of designing design spaces. In each step of this approach, our aims are: 0. to simplify the structure of the design space, 0. to improve the interpretability of the design space, 0. to improve or maintain the design space quality, 0. to maintain model diversity in the design space. We now apply this approach to the AnyNetX design space. AnyNetXA. For clarity, going forward we refer to the initial, unconstrained AnyNetX design space as AnyNetXA. AnyNetXB. We ﬁrst test a shared bottleneck ratio bi = b for all stages i for the AnyNetXA design space, and refer to the resulting design space as AnyNetXB. As before, we sample and train 0 models from AnyNetXB in the same settings. The EDFs of AnyNetXA and AnyNetXB, shown in Figure 0 (left), are virtually identical both in the average and best case. This indicates no loss in accuracy when coupling the bi. In addition to being simpler, the AnyNetXB is more amenable to analysis, see for example Figure 0 (right). 0Our training setup in §0 exactly follows [0]. We use SGD with momentum of 0, mini-batch size of 0 on 0 GPU, and a half-period cosine schedule with initial learning rate of 0 and weight decay of 0·0−0 Ten epochs are usually sufﬁcient to give robust population statistics. 0, r, rw0, r/0, r/0w0, r/0, r/0n, 0, 0stembodyheadw0, r/0, r/0w0, r/0, r/0stage 0stage 0wi-0, 0ri, 0riwi, ri, riblock 0block 0w0, r/0, r/0wi, ri, ri(a) network (b) body (c) stage istage 0block di……0×0, s=0wi, ri, ri⨁wi, ri, riwi/bi, ri, riwi/bi, ri, ri0×0, s=0×0, gi, s=0×0, s=0(a)Xblock, s=0wi, ri, ri⨁wi-0, 0ri, 0riwi/bi, 0ri, 0riwi/bi, ri, ri0×0, s=0×0, gi, s=0×0, s=0(b) Xblock, s=0\fFigure 0. AnyNetXB (left) and AnyNetXC (middle) introduce a shared bottleneck ratio bi = b and shared group width gi = g, respectively. This simpliﬁes the design spaces while resulting in virtually no change in the error EDFs. Moreover, AnyNetXB and AnyNetXC are more amendable to analysis. Applying an empirical bootstrap to b and g we see trends emerge, e.g., with 0% conﬁdence b ≤ 0 is best in this regime (right). No such trends are evident in the individual bi and gi in AnyNetXA (not shown). Figure 0. AnyNetXD (left) and AnyNetXE (right). We show various constraints on the per stage widths wi and depths di. In both cases, having increasing wi and di is beneﬁcial, while using constant or decreasing values is much worse. Note that AnyNetXD = AnyNetXC + wi+0 ≥ wi, and AnyNetXE = AnyNetXD + di+0 ≥ di. We explore stronger constraints on wi and di shortly. Figure 0. Example good and bad AnyNetXC networks, shown in the top and bottom rows, respectively. For each network, we plot the width wj of every block j up to the network depth d. These per-block widths wj are computed from the per-stage block depths di and block widths wi (listed in the legends for reference). AnyNetXC. Our second reﬁnement step closely follows the ﬁrst. Starting with AnyNetXB, we additionally use a shared group width gi = g for all stages to obtain AnyNetXC. As before, the EDFs are nearly unchanged, see Figure 0 (middle). Overall, AnyNetXC has 0 fewer degrees of freedom than AnyNetXA, and reduces the design space size nearly four orders of magnitude. Interestingly, we ﬁnd g > 0 is best (not shown); we analyze this in more detail in §0 AnyNetXD. Next, we examine typical network structures of both good and bad networks from AnyNetXC in Figure 0 A pattern emerges: good network have increasing widths. We test the design principle of wi+0 ≥ wi, and refer to the design space with this constraint as AnyNetXD. In Figure 0 (left) we see this improves the EDF substantially. We return to examining other options for controlling width shortly. AnyNetXE. Upon further inspection of many models (not shown), we observed another interesting trend. In addition to stage widths wi increasing with i, the stage depths di likewise tend to increase for the best models, although not necessarily in the last stage. Nevertheless, we test a design space variant AnyNetXE with di+0 ≥ di in Figure 0 (right), and see it also improves results. Finally, we note that the constraints on wi and di each reduce the design space by 0!, with a cumulative reduction of O(0) from AnyNetXA. Figure 0. Linear ﬁts. Top networks from the AnyNetX design space can be well modeled by a quantized linear parameterization, and conversely, networks for which this parameterization has a higher ﬁtting error eﬁt tend to perform poorly. See text for details. 0. The RegNet Design Space To gain further insight into the model structure, we show the best 0 models from AnyNetXE in a single plot, see Figure 0 (top-left). For each model, we plot the per-block width wj of every block j up to the network depth d (we use i and j to index over stages and blocks, respectively). See Figure 0 for reference of our model visualization. While there is signiﬁcant variance in the individual models (gray curves), in the aggregate a pattern emerges. In particular, in the same plot we show the line wj = 0·(j+0) for 0 ≤ j ≤ 0 (solid black curve, please note that the y-axis is logarithmic). Remarkably, this trivial linear ﬁt seems to explain the population trend of the growth of network widths for top models. Note, however, that this linear ﬁt assigns a different width wj to each block, whereas individual models have quantized widths (piecewise constant functions). To see if a similar pattern applies to individual models, we need a strategy to quantize a line to a piecewise constant function. Inspired by our observations from AnyNetXD and AnyNetXE, we propose the following approach. First, we introduce a linear parameterization for block widths: This parameterization has three parameters: depth d, initial width w0 > 0, and slope wa > 0, and generates a different block width uj for each block j < d. To quantize uj, we introduce an additional parameter wm > 0 that controls quantization as follows. First, given uj from Eqn. (0), we compute sj for each block j such that the following holds: uj = w0 · wsj Then, to quantize uj, we simply round sj (denoted by bsje) and compute quantized per-block widths wj via: wj = w0 · wbsj e We can convert the per-block wj to our per-stage format by simply counting the number of blocks with constant width, that is, each stage i has block width wi = w0·wi m and num- ber of blocks di = P j 0[bsje = i]. When only considering four stage networks, we ignore the parameter combinations that give rise to a different number of stages. We test this parameterization by ﬁtting to models from AnyNetX. In particular, given a model, we compute the ﬁt by setting d to the network depth and performing a grid search over w0, wa and wm to minimize the mean log-ratio (denoted by eﬁt) of predicted to observed per-block widths. Results for two top networks from AnyNetXE are shown in Figure 0 (top-right). The quantized linear ﬁts (dashed curves) are good ﬁts of these best models (solid curves). Next, we plot the ﬁtting error eﬁt versus network error for every network in AnyNetXC through AnyNetXE in Figure 0 (bottom). First, we note that the best models in each design space all have good linear ﬁts. Indeed, an empirical bootstrap gives a narrow band of eﬁt near 0 that likely contains the best models in each design space. Second, we note that on average, eﬁt improves going from AnyNetXC to AnyNetXE, showing that the linear parametrization naturally enforces related constraints to wi and di increasing. To further test the linear parameterization, we design a design space that only contains models with such linear structure. In particular, we specify a network structure via 0 parameters: d, w0, wa, wm (and also b, g). Given these, we generate block widths and depths via Eqn. (0)-(0). We refer to the resulting design space as RegNet, as it contains only simple, regular models. We sample d < 0, w0, wa < 0 0 ≤ wm ≤ 0 and b and g as before (ranges set based on eﬁt on AnyNetXE). The error EDF of RegNetX is shown in Figure 0 (left). Models in RegNetX have better average error than AnyNetX while maintaining the best models. In Figure 0 (middle) we test two further simpliﬁcations. First, using wm = 0 (doubling width between stages) slightly improves the EDF, but we note that using wm ≥ 0 performs better (shown later). Second, we test setting w0 = wa, further + bi+0 = bi + gi+0 = gi + wi+0 ≥ wi + di+0 ≥ di Table 0. Design space summary. See text for details. Figure 0. RegNetX generalization. We compare RegNetX to AnyNetX at higher ﬂops (top-left), higher epochs (top-middle), with 0-stage networks (top-right), and with various block types (bottom). In all cases the ordering of the design spaces is consistent and we see no signs of design space overﬁtting. simplifying the linear parameterization to uj = wa · (j + 0). Interestingly, this performs even better. However, to maintain the diversity of models, we do not impose either restriction. Finally, in Figure 0 (right) we show that random search efﬁciency is much higher for RegNetX; searching over just ∼0 random models is likely to yield good models. Table 0 shows a summary of the design space sizes (for RegNet we estimate the size by quantizing its continuous parameters). In designing RegNetX, we reduced the dimension of the original AnyNetX design space from 0 to 0 dimensions, and the size nearly 0 orders of magnitude. We note, however, that RegNet still contains a good diversity of models that can be tuned for a variety of settings. 0. Design Space Generalization We designed the RegNet design space in a low-compute, low-epoch training regime with only a single block type. However, our goal is not to design a design space for a single setting, but rather to discover general principles of network design that can generalize to new settings. In Figure 0, we compare the RegNetX design space to AnyNetXA and AnyNetXE at higher ﬂops, higher epochs, with 0-stage networks, and with various block types (described in the appendix). In all cases the ordering of the design spaces is consistent, with RegNetX > AnyNetXE > AnyNetXA. In other words, we see no signs of overﬁtting. These results are promising because they show RegNet can generalize to new settings. The 0-stage results show the regular structure of RegNet can generalize to more stages, where AnyNetXA has even more degrees of freedom. each ﬂop regime we apply an empirical bootstrap to obtain the range that contains best models with 0% conﬁdence (shown with blue shading) and the likely best model (black line), see also Figure 0. We observe that for best models the depths d are remarkably stable across ﬂops regimes, and b = 0 and wm ≈ 0 are best. Block and groups widths (wa, w0, g) tend to increase with ﬂops. 0w0r0 0w0 wr0 0×0 conv 0×0 gr conv 0wgr0 0wg wr0 0w wr0 0×0 dw conv 0wr0 Figure 0. Complexity metrics. Top: Activations can have a stronger correlation to runtime on hardware accelerators than ﬂops (we measure inference time for 0 images on an NVIDIA V0 GPU). Bottom: Trend analysis of complexity vs. ﬂops and best ﬁt curves (shown in blue) of the trends for best models (black curves). 0. Analyzing the RegNetX Design Space We next further analyze the RegNetX design space and revisit common deep network design choices. Our analysis yields surprising insights that don’t match popular practice, which allows us to achieve good results with simple models. As the RegNetX design space has a high concentration of good models, for the following results we switch to sampling fewer models (0) but training them for longer (0 epochs) with a learning rate of 0 (see appendix). We do so to observe more ﬁne-grained trends in network behavior. RegNet trends. We show trends in the RegNetX parameters across ﬂop regimes in Figure 0. Remarkably, the depth of best models is stable across regimes (top-left), with an optimal depth of ∼0 blocks (0 layers). This is in contrast to the common practice of using deeper models for higher ﬂop regimes. We also observe that the best models use a bottleneck ratio b of 0 (top-middle), which effectively removes the bottleneck (commonly used in practice). Next, we observe that the width multiplier wm of good models is ∼0 (top-right), similar but not identical to the popular recipe of doubling widths across stages. The remaining parameters (g, wa, w0) increase with complexity (bottom). Figure 0. We reﬁne RegNetX using various constraints (see text). The constrained variant (C) is best across all ﬂop regimes while being more efﬁcient in terms of parameters and activations. Figure 0. We evaluate RegNetX with alternate design choices. Left: Inverted bottleneck ( 0 0 ≤ b ≤ 0) degrades results and depthwise conv (g = 0) is even worse. Middle: Varying resolution r harms results. Right: RegNetY (Y=X+SE) improves the EDF. Complexity analysis. In addition to ﬂops and parameters, we analyze network activations, which we deﬁne as the size of the output tensors of all conv layers (we list complexity measures of common conv operators in Figure 0, top-left). While not a common measure of network complexity, activations can heavily affect runtime on memory-bound hardware accelerators (e.g., GPUs, TPUs), for example, see Figure 0 (top). In Figure 0 (bottom), we observe that for the best models in the population, activations increase with the square-root of ﬂops, parameters increase linearly, and runtime is best modeled using both a linear and a square-root term due to its dependence on both ﬂops and activations. RegNetX constrained. Using these ﬁndings, we reﬁne the RegNetX design space. First, based on Figure 0 (top), we set b = 0, d ≤ 0, and wm ≥ 0. Second, we limit parameters and activations, following Figure 0 (bottom). This yields fast, low-parameter, low-memory models without affecting accuracy. In Figure 0, we test RegNetX with theses constraints and observe that the constrained version is superior across all ﬂop regimes. We use this version in §0, and further limit depth to 0 ≤ d ≤ 0 (see also Appendix D). Alternate design choices. Modern mobile networks often employ the inverted bottleneck (b < 0) proposed in [0] along with depthwise conv [0] (g = 0). In Figure 0 (left), we observe that the inverted bottleneck degrades the EDF slightly and depthwise conv performs even worse relative to b = 0 and g ≥ 0 (see appendix for further analysis). Next, motivated by [0] who found that scaling the input image resolution can be helpful, we test varying resolution in Figure 0 (middle). Contrary to [0], we ﬁnd that for RegNetX a ﬁxed resolution of 0×0 is best, even at higher ﬂops. as Y and refer to the resulting design space as RegNetY). In Figure 0 (right), we see that RegNetY yields good gains. Figure 0. Top REGNETX models. We measure inference time for 0 images on an NVIDIA V0 GPU; train time is for 0 epochs on 0 GPUs with the batch size listed. Network diagram legends contain all information required to implement the models. 0. Comparison to Existing Networks We now compare top models from the RegNetX and RegNetY design spaces at various complexities to the stateof-the-art on ImageNet [0]. We denote individual models using small caps, e.g. REGNETX. We also sufﬁx the models with the ﬂop regime, e.g. 0MF. For each ﬂop regime, we pick the best model from 0 random settings of the RegNet parameters (d, g, wm, wa, w0), and re-train the top model 0 times at 0 epochs to obtain robust error estimates. Resulting top REGNETX and REGNETY models for each ﬂop regime are shown in Figures 0 and 0, respectively. In addition to the simple linear structure and the trends we analyzed in §0, we observe an interesting pattern. Namely, the higher ﬂop models have a large number of blocks in the third stage and a small number of blocks in the last stage. This is similar to the design of standard RESNET models. Moreover, we observe that the group width g increases with complexity, but depth d saturates for large models. Our goal is to perform fair comparisons and provide simple and easy-to-reproduce baselines. We note that along with better architectures, much of the recently reported gains in network performance are based on enhancements to the training setup and regularization scheme (see Table 0). As our focus is on evaluating network architectures, we perform carefully controlled experiments under the same training setup. In particular, to provide fair comparisons to classic work, we do not use any training-time enhancements. Figure 0. Top REGNETY models (Y=X+SE). The benchmarking setup and the ﬁgure format is the same as in Figure 0 0. State-of-the-Art Comparison: Mobile Regime Much of the recent work on network design has focused on the mobile regime (∼0MF). In Table 0, we compare REGNET models at 0MF to existing mobile networks. We observe that REGNETS are surprisingly effective in this regime considering the substantial body of work on ﬁnding better mobile networks via both manual design [0, 0, 0] and NAS [0, 0, 0, 0]. We emphasize that REGNET models use our basic 0 epoch schedule with no regularization except weight decay, while most mobile networks use longer schedules with various enhancements, such as deep supervision [0], Cutout [0], DropPath [0], AutoAugment [0], and so on. As such, we hope our strong results obtained with a short training schedule without enhancements can serve as a simple baseline for future work. Table 0. Mobile regime. We compare existing models using originally reported errors to RegNet models trained in a basic setup. Our simple RegNet models achieve surprisingly good results given the effort focused on this regime in the past few years. RESNE(X)T-(0) under various complexity metrics. As all models use the identical components and training settings, all observed gains are from the design of the RegNetX design space. (a) Comparisons grouped by activations. (b) Comparisons grouped by ﬂops. Table 0. RESNE(X)T comparisons. (a) Grouped by activations, REGNETX show considerable gains (note that for each group GPU inference and training times are similar). (b) REGNETX models outperform RESNE(X)T models under ﬁxed ﬂops as well. 0. Standard Baselines Comparison: ResNe(X)t Next, we compare REGNETX to standard RESNET [0] and RESNEXT [0] models. All of the models in this experiment come from the exact same design space, the former being manually designed, the latter being obtained through design space design. For fair comparisons, we compare REGNET and RESNE(X)T models under the same training setup (our standard REGNET training setup). We note that this results in improved RESNE(X)T baselines and highlights the importance of carefully controlling the training setup. Comparisons are shown in Figure 0 and Table 0. Overall, we see that REGNETX models, by optimizing the network structure alone, provide considerable improvements under all complexity metrics. We emphasize that good REGNET models are available across a wide range of compute regimes, including in low-compute regimes where good RESNE(X)T models are not available. Table 0a shows comparisons grouped by activations (which can strongly inﬂuence runtime on accelerators such as GPUs). This setting is of particular interest to the research community where model training time is a bottleneck and will likely have more real-world use cases in the future, especially as accelerators gain more use at inference time (e.g., in self-driving cars). REGNETX models are quite effective given a ﬁxed inference or training time budget. Figure 0. EFFICIENTNET comparisons. REGNETs outperform the state of the art, especially when considering activations. Table 0. EFFICIENTNET comparisons using our standard training schedule. Under comparable training settings, REGNETY outperforms EFFICIENTNET for most ﬂop regimes. Moreover, REGNET models are considerably faster, e.g., REGNETX-F0 is about 0× faster than EFFICIENTNET-B0. Note that originally reported errors for EFFICIENTNET (shown grayed out), are much lower but use longer and enhanced training schedules, see Table 0 0. State-of-the-Art Comparison: Full Regime We focus our comparison on EFFICIENTNET [0], which is representative of the state of the art and has reported impressive gains using a combination of NAS and an interesting model scaling rule across complexity regimes. To enable direct comparisons, and to isolate gains due to improvements solely of the network architecture, we opt to reproduce the exact EFFICIENTNET models but using our standard training setup, with a 0 epoch schedule and no regularization except weight decay (effect of longer schedule and stronger regularization are shown in Table 0). We optimize only lr and wd, see Figure 0 in appendix. This is the same setup as REGNET and enables fair comparisons. Results are shown in Figure 0 and Table 0. At low ﬂops, EFFICIENTNET outperforms the REGNETY. At intermediate ﬂops, REGNETY outperforms EFFICIENTNET, and at higher ﬂops both REGNETX and REGNETY perform better. We also observe that for EFFICIENTNET, activations scale linearly with ﬂops (due to the scaling of both resolution and depth), compared to activations scaling with the square-root of ﬂops for REGNETs. This leads to slow GPU training and inference times for EFFICIENTNET. E.g., REGNETX-0 is 0× faster than EFFICIENTNET-B0, while having lower error. In this work, we present a new network design paradigm. Our results suggest that designing network design spaces is a promising avenue for future research. (a) Comparisons grouped by activations. (b) Comparisons grouped by ﬂops. Table 0. RESNE(X)T comparisons on ImageNetV0 Table 0. EFFICIENTNET comparisons on ImageNetV0 Appendix A: Test Set Evaluation In the main paper we perform all experiments on the ImageNet [0] validation set. Here we evaluate our models on the ImageNetV0 [0] test set (original test set unavailable). Evaluation setup. To study generalization of models developed on ImageNet, the authors of [0] collect a new test set following the original procedure (ImageNetV0). They ﬁnd that the overall model ranks are preserved on the new test set. The absolute errors, however, increase. We repeat the comparisons from §0 on the ImageNetV0 test set. RESNE(X)T comparisons. We compare to RESNE(X)T models in Table 0. We observe that while model ranks are generally consistent, the gap between them decreases. Nevertheless, REGNETX models still compare favorably, and provide good models across ﬂop regimes, including in lowcompute regimes where good RESNE(X)T models are not available. Best results can be achieved using REGNETY. EFFICIENTNET comparisons. We compare to EFFICIENTNET models in Table 0. As before, we observe that the model ranks are generally consistent but the gap decreases. Overall, the results conﬁrm that the REGNET models perform comparably to state-of-the-art EFFICIENTNET while being up to 0× faster on GPUs. Figure 0. Additional ablations. Left: Fixed depth networks (d = 0) are effective across ﬂop regimes. Middle: Three stage networks perform poorly at high ﬂops. Right: Inverted bottleneck (b < 0) is also ineffective at high ﬂops. See text for more context. Figure 0. Swish vs. ReLU. Left: RegNetY performs better with Swish than ReLU at 0MF but worse at 0GF. Middle: Results across wider ﬂop regimes show similar trends. Right: If, however, g is restricted to be 0 (depthwise conv), Swish is much better. Appendix B: Additional Ablations In this section we perform additional ablations to further support or supplement the results of the main text. Fixed depth. In §0 we observed that the depths of our top models are fairly stable (∼0 blocks). In Figure 0 (left) we compare using ﬁxed depth (d = 0) across ﬂop regimes. To compare to our best results, we trained each model for 0 epochs. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that ﬁxed-depth networks can match the performance of variable depth networks for all ﬂop regimes, in both the average and best case. Indeed, these ﬁxed depth networks match our best results in §0 Fewer stages. In §0 we observed that the top REGNET models at high ﬂops have few blocks in the fourth stage (one or two). Hence we tested 0 stage networks at 0GF, trained for 0 epochs each. In Figure 0 (middle), we show the results and observe that the three stage networks perform considerably worse. We note, however, that additional changes (e.g., in the stem or head) may be necessary for three stage networks to perform well (left for future work). Inverted Bottleneck. In §0 we observed that using the inverted bottleneck (b < 0) degrades performance. Since our results were in a low-compute regime, in Figure 0 (right) we re-test at 0GF and 0 epochs. Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that in this regime b < 0 degrades results further. Swish vs. ReLU Many recent methods employ the Swish [0] activation function, e.g. [0]. In Figure 0, we study RegNetY with Swish and ReLU. We ﬁnd that Swish outperforms ReLU at low ﬂops, but ReLU is better at high Interestingly, if g is restricted to be 0 (depthwise ﬂops. conv), Swish performs much better than ReLU. This suggests that depthwise conv and Swish interact favorably, although the underlying reason is not at all clear. ﬂops (B) params (M) acts (M) epochs enhance error 0 Table 0. Training enhancements to EFFICIENTNET-B0. Our EFFICIENTNET-B0 reproduction with DropPath [0] and a 0 epoch training schedule (third row), achieves results slightly inferior to original results (bottom row), which additionally used RMSProp [0], AutoAugment [0], etc. Without these enhancements to the training setup results are ∼0% lower (top row), highlighting the importance of carefully controlling the training setup. Figure 0. Optimization settings. For these results, we generate a population of RegNetX models while also randomly varying the initial learning rate (lr) and weight decay (wd) for each model. These results use a batch size of 0 and are trained on 0 GPU. Top: Distribution of model error versus lr, wd, and also lr·wd (at 0 epochs and 0MF). Applying an empirical bootstrap, we see that clear trends emerge, especially for lr and lr·wd. Middle: We repeat this experiment but across various ﬂop regimes (trained for 0 epochs each); the trends are stable. Bottom: Similarly, we repeat the above while training for various number of epochs (in the 0MF regime), and observe the same trends. Based on these results, we use an lr = 0 and wd = 0·0−0 starting with §0 across all training schedules and ﬂop regimes. Figure 0. We repeat the sweep over lr and wd for EFFICIENTNET training each model for 0 epochs. The lr (with reference to a batch size of 0) and wd is stable across regimes. We use these values for all EFFICIENTNET experiments in the main text (adjusting for batch size accordingly). See Figure 0 for comparison. Appendix C: Optimization Settings Our basic training settings follow [0] as discussed in §0 To tune the learning rate lr and weight decay wd for REGNET models, we perform a study, described in Figure 0 Based on this, we set lr = 0 and wd = 0·0−0 for all models in §0 and §0. To enable faster training of our ﬁnal models at 0 epochs, we increase the number of GPUs to 0, while keeping the number of images per GPU ﬁxed. When scaling the batch size, we adjust lr using the linear scaling rule and apply 0 epoch gradual warmup [0]. To enable fair comparisons, we repeat the same optimization for EFFICIENTNET in Figure 0 Interestingly, learning rate and weight decay are again stable across complexity regimes. Finally, in Table 0 we report the sizable effect of training enhancement on EFFICIENTNET-B0. The gap may be even larger for larger models (see Table 0). Figure 0. Block types used in our generalization experiments (see §0 and Figure 0). Left: Block diagrams. Right: Comparison of RegNet with the four block types. The X block performs best. Interestingly, for the V block, residual connections give no gain. Appendix D: Implementation Details We conclude with additional implementation details. Group width compatibility. When sampling widths w and groups widths g for our models, we may end up with incompatible values (i.e. w not divisible by g). To address this, we employ a simple strategy. Namely, we set g = w if g > w and round w to be divisible by g otherwise. The ﬁnal w can be at most 0/0 different from the original w (proof omitted). For models with bottlenecks, we apply this strategy to the bottleneck width instead (and adjust widths accordingly). Group width ranges. As discussed in §0, we notice the general trend that the group widths of good models are larger in higher compute regimes. To account for this, we gradually adjust the group width ranges for higher compute regimes. For example, instead of sampling g ≤ 0, at 0GF we use 0 ≤ g ≤ 0 and allow any g divisible by 0 In §0, we showed that the RegNet design space generalizes to different block types. We describe these additional block types, shown in Figure 0, next: 0. R block: same as the X block except without groups, 0. V block: a basic block with only a single 0×0 conv, 0. VR block: same as V block plus residual connections. We note that good parameter values may differ across block types. E.g., in contrast to the X block, for the R block using b > 0 is better than b = 0. Our approach is robust to this. Y block details. To obtain the Y block, we add the SE op after the 0×0 conv of the X block, and we use an SE reduction ratio of 0/0. We experimented with these choices but found that they performed comparably (not shown). ﬁcient neural architecture search via parameter sharing. In ICML, 0. 0 [0] I. Radosavovic, J. Johnson, S.
